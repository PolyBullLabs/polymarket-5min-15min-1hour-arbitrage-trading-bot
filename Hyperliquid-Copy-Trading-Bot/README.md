## What Is This? (Hyperliquid Copy Trading Bot)

This is a **Hyperliquid copy trading bot** — a fully automated perp trading bot that watches a target trader's wallet on the Hyperliquid perpetual DEX and instantly mirrors every trade into your own account.

Whether you're looking for a **Hyperliquid perp trading bot**, a **perpetual DEX copy trading bot**, or a **crypto copy trading bot** for on-chain futures — this project covers it all.

Built on the official [`@nktkas/hyperliquid`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nktkas/hyperliquid) TypeScript SDK, this **Hyperliquid trading bot** connects via WebSocket for near-zero-latency trade replication on the Hyperliquid perp DEX.

---

## Why Use This Hyperliquid Copy Trading Bot?

- **Real-time perp copy trading** — WebSocket `userFills` subscription fires within milliseconds of the target's fill
- **Accurate proportional close logic** — if the target closes 40% of their perpetual position, the bot closes exactly 40% of yours
- **Leverage sync** — the perp trading bot matches (and caps) the target trader's leverage before opening any position
- **Periodic reconciliation** — the Hyperliquid bot compares your positions against the target every N seconds and auto-closes any that drifted
- **Full risk management** — max position size, max total exposure, max leverage, and daily loss circuit breaker
- **Market IOC orders** — uses aggressive IOC (Immediate-Or-Cancel) orders with slippage tolerance so every copy trade fills instantly
- **Graceful shutdown** — optionally closes all copied perpetual positions on Ctrl+C
- **Structured logging** — console + rotating file logs via Winston

## Quick Start — Run the Hyperliquid Copy Trading Bot

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+**
- A **Hyperliquid** account with USDC deposited on mainnet (or testnet)
- A dedicated **API wallet** — a sub-wallet that can trade but cannot withdraw funds (strongly recommended for any Hyperliquid trading bot)

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sinusflow/copy-trading-bot-hub.git
cd copy-trading-bot-hub/Hyperliquid-Copy-Trading-Bot
npm install
```

### 2. Configure the Perp Trading Bot

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in your values:

```env
# ── Required ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Private key of your dedicated trading wallet
PRIVATE_KEY=0xYourTradingWalletPrivateKey

# The wallet address whose perp trades you want to copy
TARGET_TRADER=0xTargetTraderAddressHere

# ── Sizing ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SIZE_MULTIPLIER=1.0          # 1.0 = same size as target
MAX_POSITION_SIZE_USD=1000   # max notional per position
MAX_TOTAL_EXPOSURE_USD=5000  # max sum of all open notional
MAX_LEVERAGE=10              # never exceed 10x

# ── Risk ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
MAX_DAILY_LOSS_USD=500       # pause the perp bot if daily loss hits $500

# ── Network ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NETWORK=testnet              # always test on testnet first!
```

### 3. Run the Hyperliquid Perp Bot

**Development mode (auto-reloads on file changes):**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Production (compile then run):**
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## How the Hyperliquid Copy Trading Bot Works

### Step 1 — WebSocket Fill Subscription

The **Hyperliquid copy trading bot** subscribes to the `userFills` WebSocket channel for the target trader's address.
Every time the target gets a trade fill on the Hyperliquid perp DEX, the bot receives an event containing:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `coin` | Perpetual market (e.g., `"BTC"`, `"ETH"`, `"SOL"`) |
| `dir` | `"Open Long"` / `"Close Long"` / `"Open Short"` / `"Close Short"` |
| `sz` | Size of the fill |
| `px` | Fill price |
| `startPosition` | The target's position size **before** this fill |
| `side` | `"B"` = buy/long, `"A"` = ask/sell/short |

### Step 2 — Copy Size Calculation

**Opening a perp position** (`dir` contains `"Open"`):
```
copySize = fill.sz × SIZE_MULTIPLIER
copySize = min(copySize, MAX_POSITION_SIZE_USD / currentMidPrice)
```

**Closing a perp position** (`dir` contains `"Close"`):
```
closePercent = fill.sz / |startPosition|    ← % of their position they exited
copySize     = |ourPosition.szi| × closePercent  ← same % of ours
```

This proportional close logic ensures the **perp copy trading bot** stays in sync even when the target partially reduces a position.

### Step 3 — Leverage Sync

Before opening any copied perpetual position, the **Hyperliquid perp bot** fetches the target's current leverage for that coin and applies it to our account — capped at `MAX_LEVERAGE`.

### Step 4 — IOC Order Execution

All copy orders are placed as **IOC (Immediate-Or-Cancel)** limit orders with a slippage buffer:

- **Buy / Long**: `price = midPrice × (1 + SLIPPAGE_BPS / 10000)` → priced above market to guarantee fill
- **Sell / Short**: `price = midPrice × (1 - SLIPPAGE_BPS / 10000)` → priced below market to guarantee fill

This makes every copy trade behave like a market order without paying the spread of an explicit market order type.

### Step 5 — Reconciliation

Every `RECONCILE_INTERVAL_MS` milliseconds, the **Hyperliquid copy trading bot** runs a reconciliation loop:

1. Fetches the target's live open perpetual positions
2. Fetches our current open positions
3. For any managed coin where the **target is now flat but we still hold** → closes our position
4. Logs a warning if our size has drifted significantly from the expected scaled size

## Risk Management

The **perp trading bot** includes multiple layers of risk control:

| Guard | Config Variable | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Max position size | `MAX_POSITION_SIZE_USD` | Rejects any copy order where notional > limit |
| Max total exposure | `MAX_TOTAL_EXPOSURE_USD` | Rejects if adding this position would push total notional over limit |
| Max leverage | `MAX_LEVERAGE` | Caps leverage for all copied perpetual positions |
| Daily loss limit | `MAX_DAILY_LOSS_USD` | Pauses the entire bot until midnight UTC if cumulative realized loss hits limit |
| Minimum notional | Hard-coded $5 | Skips micro-trades that would generate dust positions |
| Retry logic | Built-in | All API calls retry up to 3× with exponential back-off |

---

## Security Best Practices for Any Hyperliquid Trading Bot

1. **Use a dedicated API wallet, never your main wallet.**
   Hyperliquid lets you authorize a separate wallet that can trade but cannot withdraw. If your API key for the copy trading bot is ever compromised, your funds remain safe.

2. **Never commit `.env` to git.**
   The `.gitignore` already excludes it, but double-check before pushing.

3. **Always test on testnet first.**
   Set `NETWORK=testnet` and get free testnet USDC from the Hyperliquid Discord. Run the perp copy trading bot for at least 24 hours on testnet before going live.

4. **Start small.**
   Use `SIZE_MULTIPLIER=0.1` to copy at 10% of the target's size. Validate the Hyperliquid bot's behavior before scaling.

5. **Set `MAX_DAILY_LOSS_USD`.**
   Always configure a daily loss limit so the perp trading bot pauses automatically if something unexpected happens.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does this Hyperliquid copy trading bot work with spot markets?**
No — the bot filters out spot fills automatically and only copies perpetual (perp) trades on Hyperliquid.

**Q: What happens if the target trader gets liquidated?**
A liquidation fill appears as a `"Liquidated Long"` or `"Liquidated Short"` direction. The bot will not try to copy a liquidation — it skips unknown `dir` values and the reconciliation loop will detect the now-flat position and close ours.

**Q: Can I copy multiple traders at once?**
The current architecture supports one target trader per bot instance. To copy multiple traders, run multiple bot instances with different `.env` files.

**Q: What is the minimum balance to run this perp copy trading bot?**
At least $50 USDC is recommended. The bot skips any copy order where the notional is below $5 (to avoid dust), and you'll need margin for positions.

**Q: Does the Hyperliquid perp bot handle WebSocket disconnects?**
Yes. The `WebSocketTransport` from the SDK automatically reconnects. The reconciliation loop (default: every 60 seconds) acts as a safety net to re-sync positions after any reconnection.
